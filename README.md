# ModAL (Modular Arithmetic Library)
This library implements fast modular arithmetic for big number and fixed width
integer arithmetic in Rust. This is useful for cryptographic applications in particular.

# Dependencies
ModAL presently requires a nightly version of Rust (>= 1.11 nightly) for because it uses
some untable testing features.
