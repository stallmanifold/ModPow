# ModAL (Modular Arithmetic Library)
This library implements modular arithmetic for big number and fixed width
integer arithmetic in Rust. The eventual goal for this library is to be a 
fast number theory library for cryptographic applications.

# Dependencies
ModAL presently requires a nightly version of ```rust (>= 1.11 nightly)``` since it
uses benchmark testing features not available in the stable version.
